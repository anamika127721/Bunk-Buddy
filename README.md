### Project Description
A sassy, overdramatic attendance advisor that calculates your safe bunk limit while roasting you for showing up and celebrating every class you skip. Packed with a fake excuse generator, bunk  forecasts, sarcastic mood analysis, and ridiculous achievements, it even rewards you for going below the safe limit with ironic badges and ‚Äúmotivational‚Äù chaos.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It addresses the ‚Äúwhy stop at safe bunking?‚Äù problem for students who see attendance rules as mere suggestions. Instead of simply keeping you above the threshold, it boldly encourages‚Äîand hilariously celebrates‚Äîcrossing it, turning reckless absenteeism into an art form with tracking, sarcastic praise, and achievement badges for your academic rebellion.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It provides a tongue-in-cheek ‚Äúattendance management‚Äù system that doesn‚Äôt just track your classes ‚Äî it actively tempts you to skip more. By combining precise bunk calculations with fake excuses, sarcastic alerts, and achievement rewards for even reckless absences, it transforms irresponsible attendance into a fully gamified (and oddly motivating)¬†experience
