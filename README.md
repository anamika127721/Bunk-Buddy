### Project Description
A sassy, overdramatic attendance advisor that calculates your safe bunk limit while roasting you for showing up and celebrating every class you skip. Packed with a fake excuse generator, bunk  forecasts, sarcastic mood analysis, and ridiculous achievements, it even rewards you for going below the safe limit with ironic badges and “motivational” chaos.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It addresses the “why stop at safe bunking?” problem for students who see attendance rules as mere suggestions. Instead of simply keeping you above the threshold, it boldly encourages—and hilariously celebrates—crossing it, turning reckless absenteeism into an art form with tracking, sarcastic praise, and achievement badges for your academic rebellion.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It provides a tongue-in-cheek “attendance management” system that doesn’t just track your classes — it actively tempts you to skip more. By combining precise bunk calculations with fake excuses, sarcastic alerts, and achievement rewards for even reckless absences, it transforms irresponsible attendance into a fully gamified (and oddly motivating) experience

### Project Documentation
For Software:
1. Project Overview
The Sassy Attendance Advisor is a playful, overdramatic web tool that calculates how many more classes you can bunk, tracks your attendance history, and—instead of encouraging responsible habits—cheers you on to skip beyond the safe limit. It roasts you for attending, celebrates your absences, and gamifies bunking with fake excuses, sarcastic weather-style forecasts, and bizarre achievements.

2. Problem Statement
Students often struggle to balance their attendance between staying above the minimum required percentage and living their best "I’ll do it tomorrow" life. But for the truly adventurous, even the safe limit feels restrictive. There’s no tool that encourages irresponsible bunking while still tracking it with mathematical precision.

3. Solution
This project provides an “attendance management” platform that not only tracks safe bunkable classes but also pushes you to cross the threshold. It delivers:

Real-time safe bunk limit calculations.

Roasting, sarcasm, and ironic motivation for attending class.

Gamification of skipping through badges, streaks, and humorous milestones.

Predictive “last possible bunk date” and “bunk forecast” reports.

4. Core Features (Actually Useful)
Safe Bunk Calculator – Shows exactly how many more classes you can skip before hitting danger.

Attendance Tracker – Logs attended and bunked classes with dates.

Threshold Prediction – Predicts the last possible day you can bunk without total doom.

5. Fun Features (Completely Unnecessary but Essential)
Excuse Generator – Creates absurd reasons for your absence:

“My bed wouldn’t let me go.”

“Attending an emergency staring contest with the ceiling.”

Bunk Forecast – Weather-style updates:

“Today’s bunk chance: 92%. Expect heavy Netflix showers.”

Attendance Mood Analyzer – Labels you based on bunk streaks:

“Ghost of the Classroom”

“Disappointment to Education”

Achievement System – Unlock sarcastic badges:

Long Weekend Warrior – Bunked a Monday.

Bunk Streak God – Skipped 5 classes in a row.

Bunk Alarm – Push notifications that guilt-trip you for going to class.
